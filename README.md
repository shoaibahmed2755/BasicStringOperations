# Basic String Operations in Java

## Overview
This Java program performs basic string operations including character extraction, string comparison, string search, and string modification. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to manipulate and analyze strings using built-in Java methods.

## Features
- **Character Extraction:** Extracts the first and last characters of a given string.
- **String Comparison:** Compares two strings with and without case sensitivity.
- **String Search:** Searches for specific characters or substrings within a string.
- **String Modification:** Replaces parts of a string and converts the string to upper or lower case.

## Code Description
The main class `p5` contains a `main` method that demonstrates various string operations:
1. **Character Extraction:**
   - Extracts the first and last characters of the string "hello world".
2. **String Comparison:**
   - Compares the string "hello world" with "hello,world" for equality and case-insensitive equality.
3. **String Search:**
   - Finds the index of a comma and the word "world" in the strings.
   - Checks if the string contains the word "world".
4. **String Modification:**
   - Replaces the word "world" with "java" in the string.
   - Converts the string to uppercase and lowercase.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a file named `p5.java`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `p5.java`.
4. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac p5.java
